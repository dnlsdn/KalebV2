## Step 6 — ESP32 Power Integration (GND + 5V)

### Objective

Integrate the ESP32 DevKitC into the robot’s power architecture by:

- Connecting its **ground** to the system’s **Punto Stella GND**
- Supplying a stable, regulated **5.00V** from the LM2596 buck converter to the ESP32 5V pin

This ensures a clean, noise-free reference and a safe, regulated power input for the microcontroller.



---

### Materials

- ESP32 DevKitC
- LM2596 buck converter (5V output already calibrated)
- WAGO 5-pole connector (ground star point)
- Dupont cables (female–female and male–female)
- Multimeter (continuity test)
- 24 AWG silicone wire (optional, not needed in this case)
- Soldering iron (only for LM2596 OUT+ pin already prepared)



---

### Safety

- **Do NOT connect the LiPo battery yet.**
- Ensure LM2596 is still outputting **5.00V** before connecting the ESP32.
- Avoid connecting VIN and 5V simultaneously on the ESP32.
- Verify continuity after each connection (GND first, then 5V).
- GND must always be connected **before** 5V to prevent floating logic levels.

# L1 — ESP32 GND → Punto Stella WAGO

### Procedure

1. Identify one of the ESP32 **GND** pins (recommended: the GND next to the 5V pin).
2. Use a **dupont maschio–femmina** cable:
   - **Femmina** → ESP32 GND pin
   - **Maschio** → directly into an empty WAGO slot
3. Insert the male dupont pin into the WAGO and close the lever.
4. Pull gently to verify retention.

### Test (continuity)

Multimeter in **buzzer mode**:

- Red probe → XT60 negative (battery ground)
- Black probe → ESP32 GND pin

**Expected:** 🔔 **BEEP**

### Result

ESP32 ground is now bonded to the system ground, ensuring stable operation and valid reference for all sensors.

# L2 — ESP32 5V → LM2596 OUT+

### Procedure

1. The LM2596 OUT+ pin already has a soldered male header.
2. Use a **dupont femmina–femmina** cable:
   - One side → LM2596 **OUT+** pin
   - Other side → ESP32 **5V** pin
3. Ensure both female ends are firmly seated on their respective pins.

### Test (continuity)

Multimeter in **buzzer mode**:

- Red probe → LM2596 OUT+ pin
- Black probe → ESP32 5V pin (metal portion)

**Expected:** 🔔 **BEEP**

### Result

A clean, regulated 5.00V supply now powers the ESP32 safely and directly.



---

### Final Results

- ESP32 GND connected to the **Punto Stella GND** via WAGO  
- ESP32 powered through a **stable 5V rail** from the LM2596  
- All continuity tests passed  
- No exposed copper or loose wires  
- ESP32 now ready for **I²C bus wiring** (PCA9685, MPU6050, OLED, sensors)

---

### Interpretation

These two steps complete the “core power integration” for the ESP32:

- GND ensures a unified reference for all logic
- 5V ensures safe, stable operation under load
- The ESP32 is now part of the robot’s electrical architecture

This prepares the system for the next steps involving the PCA9685, sensors, and communication buses.

### Acceptance Criteria

- ESP32 GND → WAGO shows continuity → **Pass**
- ESP32 5V → LM2596 OUT+ shows continuity → **Pass**
- No shorts across LM2596 output pins → **Pass**
- Dupont connections firm and secure → **Pass**
- ESP32 ready for I2C setup → **Pass**
