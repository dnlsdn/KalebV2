## About Me

I am a Master's student in **Computer Engineering – Cybersecurity curriculum** at Roma Tre University (Italy).  
Robotics and electronics are not my main field of study — they are simply a **passion project** I pursue in my spare time.

Because of this, many of the steps in this repository may seem basic or overly detailed, but that is intentional:  
**my goal is to help beginners like me build a complex hobby robot from scratch without fear or confusion.**

## Purpose of This Repository

This project serves as:

- a **complete, step-by-step build log** of my SpotMicro robot  
- a **beginner-friendly guide**, with each step explained clearly and practically  
- a place to store **photos, wiring diagrams, and notes** for each stage  
- a **public reference** for anyone who wants to follow the same path  
- a **personal archive** of my progress, mistakes, and solutions  

Each step is documented inside the `main-steps/` directory.  
Most steps include photos or illustrations.

## Disclaimer

This is a hobby project.  
I am learning robotics and electronics as I go, so expect simple explanations, incremental learning, and occasional mistakes.  
Everything I publish here is meant to help other beginners who want to start a similar adventure.
